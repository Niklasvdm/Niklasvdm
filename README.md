Hi there 👋 I’m Niklas Van der Mersch

I’m a Security Architect & Software Developer passionate about secure systems, creative automation, and design that just makes sense.

# 👨‍💻 About Me
🔐 Currently working as a Security Architect — bridging the gap between compliance (GDPR, NIST, DORA) and practical, technical security. <br> 
🧠 Obsessed with security architecture, automation pipelines, and making compliance be easy for the engineers.<br>
🧰 Building tools that blend Bash, Python, and infrastructure automation to secure modern environments (from Azure to homelabs).<br>
🧑‍🔬 Constantly experimenting with reverse engineering, firmware analysis, and network segmentation in my homelab (Ubiquiti, VLANs, DMZs… you name it).<br>

# 🚀 Current Projects

🧰 ReverseProxy-WAF – A for from the popular NGINX-Modsecurity, I brought it to my LXC container using Terraform with enhanced rules and custom security. <br>
🏠 Homelab – Starting from PlantUML, figuring out topologies for VLAN and DMZ mapping. Producing public endpoints safely hidden away behind authentication. Using **ProxMox** for virtualization and isolation.<br>
🩻 N8N – Making simple automatons to enhance my life one workflow at a time.<br>

# ⚡ Fun Fact

When I’m not securing systems, I’m probably designing stickers, rooms, or scripts — or automating the next thing that shouldn’t need automating.
