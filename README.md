Hi there 👋 I’m Niklas

I’m a Security Architect & Software Developer passionate about secure systems, creative automation, and design that just makes sense.

# 👨‍💻 About Me
🔐 Currently working as a Security Architect — bridging the gap between compliance (GDPR, NIST, DORA) and practical, technical security. <br> 
🧠 Obsessed with security architecture, automation pipelines, and making compliance actually usable.
🧰 Building tools that blend Bash, Python, and infrastructure automation to secure modern environments (from Azure to homelabs).
🧩 On the creative side, I run a small product line for minimalist pictogram stickers — blending design, production, and marketing.
🧑‍🔬 Constantly experimenting with reverse engineering, firmware analysis, and network segmentation in my homelab (Ubiquiti, VLANs, DMZs… you name it).

# 🚀 Current Projects

🧰 VideoServer – A project to set up a local web-based video server to stream childhood memories from my phone to my TV. Use Bash scripting & FFMPEG to transform all sorts of audio files
🏠 Homelab – Starting from PlantUML, figuring out topologies for VLAN and DMZ mapping. Producing public endpoints safely hidden away behind authentication
🩻 Sticker Studio – EU-made transparent, scratch-resistant pictogram stickers for switches and devices.

# 🌱 Currently Exploring

# ⚡ Fun Fact

When I’m not securing systems, I’m probably designing stickers, rooms, or scripts — or automating the next thing that shouldn’t need automating.
